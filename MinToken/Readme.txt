Audit request

MinToken is an Ethereum based token. It aims to create an industry for the ease of payment of goods and services.

The token project will be a tool to raise funds to finance the production of an innovative project for the production of Bioplastics.

The traceability of the entire production chain of the bioplastic will be guaranteed by the use of blockchain technology that allows to trace all the production cycles, with mathematical reliability, from the raw material to the finished product. The buyers of the EarthBi bioplastic will have the certainty that it actually has the characteristics of declared biodegradability and technical efficacy.

An innovative product for the biobased and biodegradable plastic market.

The token project has not started yet and I wanted to have a smart contract audit if possible.
